        "2. **Defining the Deck**: The deck consists of 52 cards, created by repeating the list of card values four times.\n",
        "3. **Shuffling the Deck**: The `random.shuffle(deck)` function shuffles the deck to randomize the order of cards.\n",
        "4. **Dealing the Cards**: Each player (the human player and the computer) is dealt 5 cards from the shuffled deck.\n",
        "5. **Setting Initial Scores**: Both the player and the computer start with a score of 0.\n",
        "6. **Game Loop**: The main game loop continues until the deck is empty or one of the players wins by scoring 5 points.\n",
        "7. **Player's Turn**: The player is prompted to ask for a card. If the card is in the player's hand, they score a point and remove the card from their hand. If not, they \"go fish\" by drawing a card from the deck.\n",
        "8. **Computer's Turn**: The computer randomly selects a card to ask for. The process is similar to the player's turn.\n",
        "9. **Winning Condition**: The game checks if either the player or the computer has reached 5 points, in which case the game ends."
